FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (exec-boundary) begin
  (child-simple) run
  child-simple: exit(81)
  (exec-boundary) fork
  (exec-boundary) wait
  (exec-boundary) end
  exec-boundary: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (exec-boundary) begin
- (child-simple) run
- child-simple: exit(81)
- (exec-boundary) fork
- (exec-boundary) wait
- (exec-boundary) end
- exec-boundary: exit(0)
+ exec-boundary: exit(-1)
