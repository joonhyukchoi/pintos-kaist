Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-twice) begin
  (mmap-twice) open "sample.txt" #0
  (mmap-twice) mmap "sample.txt" #0 at 0x10000000
  (mmap-twice) open "sample.txt" #1
  (mmap-twice) mmap "sample.txt" #1 at 0x20000000
  (mmap-twice) compare mmap'd file 0 against data
  (mmap-twice) compare mmap'd file 1 against data
  (mmap-twice) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-twice) begin
  (mmap-twice) open "sample.txt" #0
  (mmap-twice) mmap "sample.txt" #0 at 0x10000000
- (mmap-twice) open "sample.txt" #1

- (mmap-twice) compare mmap'd file 0 against data
- (mmap-twice) compare mmap'd file 1 against data
