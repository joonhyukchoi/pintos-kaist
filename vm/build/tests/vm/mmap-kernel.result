FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-kernel) begin
  (mmap-kernel) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 0
  (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 1
  (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 2
  (mmap-kernel) end
  mmap-kernel: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-kernel) begin
  (mmap-kernel) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 0
- (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 1
- (mmap-kernel) try to mmap over kernel 2
- (mmap-kernel) end
- mmap-kernel: exit(0)
+ mmap-kernel: exit(-1)
