FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-inherit) begin
  (mmap-inherit) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-inherit) mmap "sample.txt"
  (mmap-inherit) exec "child-inherit"
  (child-inherit) begin
  child-inherit: exit(-1)
  (mmap-inherit) checking that mmap'd file still has same data
  (mmap-inherit) end
  mmap-inherit: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-inherit) begin
  (mmap-inherit) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-inherit) mmap "sample.txt"
- (mmap-inherit) exec "child-inherit"
- (child-inherit) begin
- child-inherit: exit(-1)
- (mmap-inherit) checking that mmap'd file still has same data
- (mmap-inherit) end
- mmap-inherit: exit(0)
+ mmap-inherit: exit(-1)
