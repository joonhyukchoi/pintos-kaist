FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-exit) begin
  (child-mm-wrt) begin
  (child-mm-wrt) create "sample.txt"
  (child-mm-wrt) open "sample.txt"
  (child-mm-wrt) mmap "sample.txt"
  (child-mm-wrt) end
  (mmap-exit) open "sample.txt" for verification
  (mmap-exit) verified contents of "sample.txt"
  (mmap-exit) close "sample.txt"
  (mmap-exit) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
- (mmap-exit) begin
- (child-mm-wrt) begin
- (child-mm-wrt) create "sample.txt"
- (child-mm-wrt) open "sample.txt"
- (child-mm-wrt) mmap "sample.txt"
- (child-mm-wrt) end
- (mmap-exit) open "sample.txt" for verification
- (mmap-exit) verified contents of "sample.txt"
- (mmap-exit) close "sample.txt"
- (mmap-exit) end
