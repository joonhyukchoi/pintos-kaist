Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-write) begin
  (mmap-write) create "sample.txt"
  (mmap-write) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-write) mmap "sample.txt"
  (mmap-write) compare read data against written data
  (mmap-write) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-write) begin
  (mmap-write) create "sample.txt"
  (mmap-write) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-write) mmap "sample.txt"
- (mmap-write) compare read data against written data
- (mmap-write) end
