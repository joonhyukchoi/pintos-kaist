Acceptable output:
  (mmap-remove) begin
  (mmap-remove) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-remove) mmap "sample.txt"
  (mmap-remove) remove "sample.txt"
  (mmap-remove) try to open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-remove) create "another"
  (mmap-remove) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-remove) begin
  (mmap-remove) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-remove) mmap "sample.txt"
- (mmap-remove) remove "sample.txt"
- (mmap-remove) try to open "sample.txt"
- (mmap-remove) create "another"
- (mmap-remove) end
