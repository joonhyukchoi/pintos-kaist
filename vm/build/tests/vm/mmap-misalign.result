Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:

  (mmap-misalign) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-misalign) try to mmap at misaligned address
  (mmap-misalign) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-misalign) begin
  (mmap-misalign) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-misalign) try to mmap at misaligned address
- (mmap-misalign) end
