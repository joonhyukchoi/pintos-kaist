  (fork-boundary) child run
  child-simple: exit(54)
  (fork-boundary) fork
  (fork-boundary) wait
  (fork-boundary) end
  fork-boundary: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
- (fork-boundary) begin
- (fork-boundary) child run
- child-simple: exit(54)
- (fork-boundary) fork
- (fork-boundary) wait
- (fork-boundary) end
- fork-boundary: exit(0)
